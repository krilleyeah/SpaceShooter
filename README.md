# Space Shooter

![](./img/game-screenshot.jpg)

## Summary
This Space Shooter game is a rendition of the classic space shooter arcade games. I developed this game as a project that is part of the Ironhack Fullstack developer course in 2024.

## How to play

- Use the arrow keys to move.
- Hit the space bar to fire.

The goal of the game is to destroy as many enemy ships as possible.
Avoid collisions with enemies and laser beams. Collisions will
have a bigger impact on your ships energy level as being hit
by laser beams.
