## Summary
Frogger Arcade game is a slight cariation of the classic Frogger Arcade Game developed by Konami. I made this game as a project that is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

## How to play

Use the arrow keys to move.
Use the space bar to fire.

The goal of the game is to destroy as many enemy ships as possible.
Avoid collisions with enemies and laser beams. Collisions will
have a bigger impact on your ships energy level as being hit
by laser beams.
